## Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?
-	Slack, Remo, Trello
- When communicating, everyone mutes except for the speaker. The speaker is loud and clear and willing to repeat if necessary. 
-	Vote over disagreements. In a tie, coin-flip or rock-paper-scissors. If the decision is big, we make a Stack Overflow post or Reddit post and let the beasts decide. 
-	Psychological Safety: Make it a safe space. Initiate a 15-minute cooldown when heated, and then come together as a group to discuss *calmly* the problem at hand. If all else fails, Call in a TA as a last resort. If things get heated with TA, call Roger. 
-	If cannot make a meeting time within short notice: Slack group and let Roger know you have informed your group that you will not be available on that day. If there are prior commitments, just tell the group ahead of time. 

## Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
- Talk it out, then take a vote. If tie, coin-flip or RPS. 
-	We agree not to have conflicts because we agreed to handle things with empathy and love! 
-	15-minute cooldown if needed before talking it out. Calling a TA or Roger is a last resort. 

## Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used?
-	Trello organization. This is where we will keep track of who has done what, who is currently working on what, and the overall progress of the project. 
-	Tasks will be identified through preparatory wireframing and relational diagrams used to develop the initial project concept.
-	Use Github to control what is being pushed up to both the development and production branches.
-	To ensure that all team members can work on substantial components, major tasks will be evenly divided during daily standups and ownership will be visually flagged on Trello. 
-	If changes to project function or priorities are made, ensure they are reflected in new Trello features so that team members have a point of reference.

## Git process: What lives on GitHub? What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
-	Updates are pushed either at the end or start of a workday. We will play this by ear and push as needed. All group members must push their changes (if applicable) and conduct code review of any extra work completed to ensure everyone is on the same page.
-	Have separate Dev and Main branches. All members push their **well named** branches into Dev, and then together we choose to push to master.
-	A pull request needs to be verified/approved by any two team members. Everyone in the group should be aware of all changes being merged. 
-	We will have all of our code, distinguishable branches, and documentation located on our Github repo. 
-	The person who created the pull request may NOT be one of the two to approve but must be the one to do the actual merge once approved. 
-	Any time someone things we should merge, we will discuss either in Remo or on Slack. 

## Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times (outside of the ones scheduled with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc.
-	Schedule: M-Th: 6:30pm-9:30pm, Sat: 9:00am-6:00pm. Talk about potentially coming together on Friday. If we put in work on Friday, when/how long will depend on what work needs to be done. This will be planned EOD Thursday.
-	If work is put in on Friday, we will recap/code review what was done with the rest of the team on the following Saturday.  
-	15-minute rule: Ask teammates to get unblocked. If not unblocked in 15 minutes, ask a TA for help. Get Roger if still super stuck after another 15 minutes.
